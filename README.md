In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with at least 100 total points. On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll, up to 10. That player's score for the turn is the sum of the dice outcomes. There are also several special rules:

Pig Out. If any of the dice outcomes is a 1, the current player's score for the turn is 1.

Free Bacon. A player who chooses to roll zero dice scores points equal to ten minus the minimum of the ones and tens digit of the opponent's score.

Feral Hogs. If the number of dice you roll is exactly 2 away (absolute difference) from the number of dice you rolled on the previous turn, you get 3 extra points for the turn. Treat the turn before the first turn as rolling 0 dice.

Swine Swap. After points for the turn are added to the current player's score, if the first (leftmost) digit of the current player's score multiplied by the last (rightmost) digit of the current player's score are equal to the first (leftmost) digit of the other player's score multiplied by the last (rightmost) digit of the other player's score, then the two scores are swapped.
